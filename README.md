### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- User can search Pokemon by name
- Correct Pokemon info and picture populates on page
- Previous search info clears when a new Pokemon is searched

#### PostMVP  

- Add CSS animation when loading a new Pokemon
- Style the 'submit' button to be an image with some animation
